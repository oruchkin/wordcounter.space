<h4 style="text-align: left;">What is wordcounter.space:</h4>

<div class="whatISit">

In short: service that allows you to conduct your own research in the field of the most used words of any language
(easily and for free)
<hr>

In detail: when you learn a new language, you will inevitably face the problem of choosing the words that you need to learn
<br>
<br>
According to google:
<br>
There are more than a million English words
<br>
about 170 000 words in current use
<br>
and 20 000 - 30 000 words used by each individual person
<br>
<br>
In fact, it is enough to know 7000 words to be fluent in the language.
<br>
So, the problem is how to get the list of these 7000 words<br>

In addition, about 20% of these 7000 words = 1400 words are used in 50% of all everyday conversations.
<br>
<br>
I'm sure you've seen these "must-know" dictionaries.<br>
But who did them?<br>
Can you trust these random researchers?<br>
Absolutely not!<br>
We are all different, and we use different vocabulary<br>
<br>

So this site allow you to make your own dictionary of words<br>
and learn important words first
